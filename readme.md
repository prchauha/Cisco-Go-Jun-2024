## Why Go?
- Concurrency
    - Managed Concurrency using "Goroutines"
    - Very cheap (~4KB)
    - Very efficient
    - Support is built in  the "language" itself
        - go "keyword", channel "data type", channel "operator" ( <- ), range & select-case "constructs"
    - API support through standard library
        - "sync" package
        - "sync/atomic" package
- Lightweight
    - Compiled to machine code
    - Execution Speed (equivalent to c++)
- Simplicity
    - ONLY 25 keywords
    - No access modifiers (public/private/protected)
    - No reference types (everything is a value)
    - No class (only structs)
    - No inheritance (only composition)
    - No exceptions (only errors)
    - No "try-catch-finally"
    - No implicity type conversion
    - No pointer arithmatic
